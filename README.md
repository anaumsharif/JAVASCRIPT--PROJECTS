#JAVASCRIPT
JavaScript is a dynamic programming language that's used for web development, in web applications, for game development, and lots more.
It allows you to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be done with only HTML and CSS.
HTML defines the structure of your web document and the content therein. CSS declares various styles for the contents provided on the web document.
HTML and CSS are often called markup languages rather than programming languages, because they, at their core, provide markups for documents with very little dynamism.
JavaScript, on the other hand, is a dynamic programming language that supports Math calculations, allows you to dynamically add HTML contents to the DOM, creates dynamic style declarations, fetches contents from another website, and lots more.
